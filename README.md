# DataStructuresPy
Repo for basic data structures

## Nodes
Includes functionality for nodes that are used throughout the data structures. Nodes2 is only used for the hashamp as it includes the key attribute which is necessary

## DoublyLinkedList
> A linked list is a linear data structure where items are arranged in linear order and linked (connected) to each other.

Functionalities include:
- adding / removing elements
- searching for elements
- returning smallest and greatest elements
- iteration

## Stack
> Stack is also a linear order structure, but it works in a LIFO (Last in First Out) order. It means the last-placed element can be accessed first.

_unfinished_


## Queue
> Queues are the same as Stack structure, but they donâ€™t follow the LIFO model. A queue follows the FIFO (First in First Out) model. This means the first element can be accessed first.

Functionalities include:
- enqueueing
- dequeuing
- determening length of queue
- iteration

## HashMap
> The hash table data structure connects each value with a key and stores them. To map any size of data set to one fixed size, the hash table uses the hash function. The values returned by a hash function are known as hash values

Functionalities include:
- inserting / removing data
- looking for data
- setting and changing the hash function
